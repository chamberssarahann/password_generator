Week 3 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

I created a password generator so that employees can meet password requirements and have secure passwords without being tempted to use an old familiar and insecure password for sensistive work applications. I learned a lot about javascript in general during this project. I'm still getting familiar with the language itself, and it's not very intuitive for me so far. Some things feel like they're written backwards, but in thinking about it as a literal new language like Spanish, that helped reassure me that I was doing things correctly. 

## Installation

No special steps required. Simply access the password generator via any browser which is connected to the internet.

## Usage

1. What you'll see on page load

## Credits

Special thanks to Sarun Thunyapauksanon for offering to help throughout, and helping me stay on track.

Also need to say thank you to three separate tutors who helped me push the userOptions into that var so that I could apply math.floor to it to get my finalPassword.
