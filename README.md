# Password Generator

## Description

I created a password generator that can give you a secure password which meets specific requirements for security (ie between 8-128 characters, and have a combination of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers). This way, hypothetical work apps are going to be more secure than if they were accesible via a re-used user password like 'Password123'.

## Installation

No installation necessary, simple access the website from any web-connected browser of your choosing. 

## Usage

To use the passwrod generator, you can use the visual cues below:

Make selections for remainder options (uppercase, lowercase, special characters, numbers)

Then, you may copy your new password, and ideally, save it to your preferred password manager application for sake-keeping
